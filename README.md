## Goals

## How to Use
1. Download the file to your computer.
2. Open up the code in an IDE of your choice.
3. Install any of the necessary libraries that are imported in this script using `pip install`.
4. Get the Twitter credentials at (insert where to get them), and replace the fields with those credentials.
5. If you'd like, replace the current politicians that are being used with your desired politicians.
6. Run the code. It will likely be stopped due to rate limiting and you'll have to wait 15 minutes for it to run again. This may happen more than once.
